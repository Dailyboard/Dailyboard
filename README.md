# Welcome to [Dailyboard.io](https://dailyboard.io)!
We use this repository to publish our change log (new releases) and to gather technical issues reports.

## Get notified about new releases on Slack!
Using a GitHub integration, you can get notifications about new releases right to your Slack workspace! To subscribe to our changelog, go to a channel where you want to receive notifications and type:
`/github subscribe https://github.com/Dailyboard/Dailyboard releases`

If you see that you were also subscribed to `issues`, `pulls`, `commits` and `deployments` (it's a GitHub-Slack integration bug), type:
`/github unsubscribe https://github.com/Dailyboard/Dailyboard issues pulls commits deployments`
